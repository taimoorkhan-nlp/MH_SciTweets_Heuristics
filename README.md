# SciTweets Detection Heuristics

## Description

This method offers a computationally inexpensive and fully transparent way to identify scientific online discourse from a dataset of social media posts. It was originally developed for analyzing tweets, but can be used for all types of social media posts. It applies word-based heuristics (see [Technical Details](#technical-details)) to identify three different forms of scientific relevance in posts:

- Category 1: The post contains a claim or question that can be scientifically verified.
- Category 2: The post references scientific findings (via a link).
- Category 3: The post mentions a scientific research context (e.g., mention of a scientist, scientific research efforts, research findings).

The strength of the method lies in its transparency, as it is based exclusively on rules that are understandable to humans.

## Use Cases

- To quickly and transparently create a social media dataset in which scientific online discourse occurs significantly more frequently than in the original data.  To do this, the method is applied to a very large dataset of social media posts and all posts that do not fall into any of the three categories according to the method are filtered out. Example:

  Hafid, S., Schellhammer, S., Bringay, S., Todorov, K., & Dietze, S. (2022, October). SciTweets-a dataset and annotation framework for detecting scientific online discourse. In *Proceedings of the 31st ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management* (pp. 3988-3992).

## Input Data

The method accepts a [tab-separated value file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) with at least one `text` column as input. The category 2 heuristics also require a 'urls' column with all resolved URLs of the main text (i.e., the actual target URLs, not the shortened ones like “https://t.co/xxx”) as a comma-separated list of strings (possibly empty) in square brackets. The input file can contain any other columns (e.g., with the post IDs). All columns in the input file are copied to the output file, with new columns added to the right.

Example input data ([data/example_tweets.tsv](data/example_tweets.tsv)):

| text | urls |
|------|------|
| In @sciencemagazine: Rare variant found that raises HDL cholesterol and increases risk of coronary heart disease: https://t.co/4xpL3KlGy9 | ['https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aad3517'] |

| "“At a point now where I understand plant temperaments — how vulnerable they are, but also how strong they can become"" #Precision #AgTech" | [] |

## Output Data

This method adds the output of the heuristics as new columns to the right of the input data. The new columns `is_catX` (`X` being 1, 2 or 3), contains `True` in a row if the respective text is identified to be from a scientific discourse as per category `X`. For full transparency, the other new columns provide the output of all intermediate steps of the heuristics (see [Technical Details](#technical-details)).

The heuristics are applied one category at a time. If the heuristics are applied in sequence to the example data (See [How to Use](#how-to-use)), the output is the same as in ([data/example_tweets_cat1_cat2_cat3.tsv](data/example_tweets_cat1_cat2_cat3.tsv)):

| text | is_claim | claim_sentence | has_sciterm | sciterms | is_cat1 | urls | sci_subdomain | has_sci_subdomain | sci_mag_domain | has_sci_mag_domain | sci_news_domain | has_sci_news_domain | is_cat2 | mentions_science_research_in_general | mentions_scientist | mentions_publications | mentions_research_method | is_cat3 |

## Hardware Requirements

This method has low hardware requirements. For example, it runs on a small machine with 1 x86 CPU core, 2 GB RAM, and 2 GB HDD. This method can run out of memory if your dataset is too large to fit into main memory (RAM).

## Environment Setup

This method requires at least Python version 3.9. To avoid problems with your system's Python installation, create and activate a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

Then install all requirements using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## How to Use

Apply the heuristics for each category to the [example input data](data/example_tweets.tsv), then display the result:

```bash
# Apply category 1 heuristics and write to data/example_tweets_cat1.tsv
python3 src/apply_cat1_claim_question_heuristics.py data/example_tweets.tsv

# Apply category 2 heuristics and write to data/example_tweets_cat1_cat2.tsv
python3 src/apply_cat2_reference_heuristics.py data/example_tweets_cat1.tsv

# Apply category 3 heuristics and write to data/example_tweets_cat1_cat2_cat3.tsv
python3 src/apply_cat3_research_context_heuristics.py data/example_tweets_cat1_cat2.tsv

# Display result
cat data/example_tweets_cat1_cat2_cat3.tsv
```

## Technical Details

This method employs a set of simple human-made rules ("heuristics") to identify whether a social media post falls into one of three categories related to scientific online discourse. The heuristics for each category are:

- Category 1: The post contains a claim or question that can be scientifically verified ([source code](src/apply_cat1_claim_question_heuristics.py)).

  - *If* the post contains a phrase with a verb from our [list of verbs that indicate a scientific inquiry](src/lists/predicates.txt) (output column `is_claim`). The list was extracted from four research works on claims [1-4]. Moreover, in the sentence (output column `claim_sentence`), the verb has to be preceded by a noun and followed by a noun or by an adjective, and there has to be no personal pronoun, possessive pronoun or person entity in the same sentence (as these would indicate a specific person doing something, not a generic case).
  - *And* the post contains at least one term from a [list of ~30k scientific terms](src/lists/wiki_sci_terms.txt) from Wikipedia Glossaries, from which we hand-picked the categories that we deemed to be related to science (e.g, "medicine," "history," "biology"), or a [list of ~1.5k scientific methods](src/lists/sc_methods.txt) (see [List of Social Science Research Methods](#list-of-social-science-research-methods)), not counting terms that are [slang words](src/lists/text_speak_words.txt) or that we identified as false scientific terms when looking at the [most frequent terms](src/lists/false_scientific_words.txt) in the dataset. Identified terms are in the output column `sciterms`, with `has_sciterm` being `True` if it has at least one.

- Category 2: The post references scientific findings (via a link; [source code](src/apply_cat2_reference_heuristics.py)).

  - *If* the post contains a URL with a domain or subdomain of a [scientific repository](src/lists/repo_subdomains.txt) (17463 URLs, see [List of Repositories](#list-of-repositories); output columns `has_sci_subdomain` (if any match) and `sci_subdomain` (first match)).
  - *Or* the post contains a URL with a domain or subdomain of a [scientific magazine](src/lists/science_mags_domains.txt) (14 magazines, manually curated; output columns `has_sci_mag_domain` (if any match) and `sci_mag_domain` (first match)).
  - *Or* the post contains a URL with a domain or subdomain of a [scientific news outlets](src/lists/news_outlets_domains.txt) and `/science` (23 URLs, manually curated from major English language newspaper outlets with a dedicated science section; output columns `has_sci_news_domain` (if any match) and `sci_news_domain` (first match)).

- Category 3: The post mentions a scientific research context (e.g., mention of a scientist, scientific research efforts, research findings; [source code](src/apply_cat3_research_context_heuristics.py)).

  - *If* the post contains a noun or proper noun from a [list of research or science phrases](/src/lists/science_research_in_general_kws.txt) (15 terms, manually curated, output column `mentions_science_research_in_general` contains the first noun found, if any).
  - *Or* the post contains a noun or proper noun from a [list of scientists](/src/lists/scientists_kws.txt) (12 terms, manually curated, output column `mentions_scientist` contains the first noun found, if any).
  - *Or* the post contains a noun or proper noun from a [list of scientific publication types](/src/lists/publications_kws.txt) (10 terms, manually curated, output column `mentions_publications` contains the first noun found, if any).
  - *Or* the post contains a term from a [list of social science research methods](/src/lists/sc_methods.txt) (1476 methods, see [List of Social Science Research Methods](#list-of-social-science-research-methods)) with at least two words (output column `mentions_research_method` contains the first term found, if any).

## List of Social Science Research Methods

The [list of 1,476 research methods](src/lists/sc_methods.txt) is collected from the [SAGE Social Science Thesaurus](https://concepts.sagepub.com/vocabularies/social-science/en/page/?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconcepts.sagepub.com%2Fsocial-science%2Fconcept%2Fconceptgroup%2Fmethods).

## List of Repositories

The [list of 17,463 subdomains](src/lists/repo_subdomains.txt) is collected as follows:

- All full-text links included in the public [CrossRef Snapshot from January 2021](https://academictorrents.com/details/e4287cb7619999709f6e9db5c359dda17e93d515) were extracted
- Using the CrossRef API, we extracted the full-text links that were registered after January 2021
- All extracted links were annotated with their subdomain using the Python library [tldextract](https://github.com/john-kurkowski/tldextract)
- The frequency for every subdomain was computed  
- We excluded subdomains with a frequency lower than 50
- We excluded 38 subdomains that are not scientific (e.g., "youtube.com", "yahoo.com")
- We added 46 subdomains from a manually curated list (e.g., "semanticscholar.org", "www.biorxiv.org")
